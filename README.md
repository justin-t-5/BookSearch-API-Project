# BookSearch-API-Project
# Web Development Project 6 -  BookSearch

Submitted by: Justin Tamay

This web app: This React Book Dashboard lets users search and filter books by title and year, displaying key stats and two dynamic charts: one showing the number of books published per year, and another highlighting the top authors by book count. It integrates React Router for detailed book views and uses Recharts to visualize the data interactively.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Notes

I had issues with npm run dev and was very frustrated but I got it working again after finding out the issue with copilot, the charts were also new this week so it was tedious figuring them out.
