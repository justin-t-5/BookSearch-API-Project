# BookSearch-API-Project
# Web Development Project 5 - BookSearch

Submitted by: Justin Tamay

This web app: This React app is a dynamic book dashboard that fetches data from the OpenLibrary API, allowing users to search and filter books by title and publication year while displaying key summary statistics about the results in real time.


Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [X] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [X] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - *insert details here*
- [X] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I initially wanted to create a project with the SeatGeek api but I could not get access to it and had to switch to the OpenLibrary/BookSearch API and had less time because I wasn't prepared to switch at the last minute.
